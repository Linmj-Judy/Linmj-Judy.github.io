excerpt: 'Considering the limitation of previous antimalarial activity prediction models in neglecting the multi-stage/multi-phenotype activity of Plasmodium, this study constructs a comprehensive data benchmark covering the three major life cycles of Plasmodium falciparum and activity test data from ten common mutant strains. Building upon this foundation, we propose an adaptive neural network, FP-GNN, which integrates molecular fingerprints and molecular graphs, effectively leveraging the advantages of chemical prior knowledge and graph representation learning. Compared to mainstream algorithms, FP-GNN achieves a 9.5% and 7.4% improvement in AUC and BA metrics, respectively, significantly enhancing the accuracy and robustness of Plasmodium activity prediction.'
